### For Developers

#### Adding New Meal Templates

1. **Update Backend Templates**
   ```javascript
   // In backend/routes/recommendations.js
   const templates = {
     weight_loss: [
       {
         mealType: 'Breakfast',
         name: 'Your New Meal',
         description: 'Meal description',
         estimatedCalories: 400,
         foodItems: [
           { name: 'Ingredient', quantity: 100, unit: 'g', calories: 200, protein: 10, carbs: 20, fat: 5 }
         ],
         benefits: ['Benefit 1', 'Benefit 2'],
         difficulty: 'Easy',
         prepTime: '10 minutes',
         tags: ['tag1', 'tag2']
       }
     ]
   };
   ```

2. **Test Recommendations**
   ```bash
   # Run the test script
   node backend/scripts/test-recommendations.js
   ```

#### Customizing Recommendation Logic

1. **Modify BMR Calculation**
   ```javascript
   function calculateBMR(user) {
     // Custom BMR calculation logic
   }
   ```

2. **Adjust Calorie Targets**
   ```javascript
   function calculateDailyCalories(bmr, fitnessGoal) {
     // Custom calorie calculation based on goals
   }
   ```

3. **Enhance Preference Analysis**
   ```javascript
   function analyzeFoodPreferences(recentMeals) {
     // Custom preference analysis logic
   }
   ```
